This project consists on a simple scaffold that can be used to start up a React project very rapidly. It integrates Webpack, ESlint, PostCss, React and Redux such that developers can immediately begin to develop their frontend.

The Webpack configuration has been primarily done following the indications on  http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/ . However much of it has been skipped for the sake of simplicity. The config doesn't include any build/production optimizations.
